########################

The purpose of the Test application (="CliApp") is to
provide cli-commands against software under test (SUT).

The application needs to behave like any other linux shell and a
`cli library <https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-cli>`_,
that provides shell functionality, like register commands and
handling Command Line Interface, is available.
Read more about [cli from here](cli.md).
